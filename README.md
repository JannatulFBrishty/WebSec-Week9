# Project 9 - Honeypot
In this project, we had to create a honeypot server, which according to [Tech Target](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/honey-pot) is a computer system that is set up to act as a decoy to lure cyberattackers, and to detect, deflect or study attempts to gain unauthorized access to information systems.


## Honeypot 1: Dionaea with HTTP
### Summary
Dionaea is a honeypot whose intention is to trap malwares that are exploiting vulnerabilities exposed by services offered to the network with the ultimate goal of gaining a copy of the attacking malware.

### Issues
It was a confusing and exasperating experience to set up Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project and VMs for this project.

### Unresolved Questions
The following nagging questions popped up to the top my head during this project:
- How do these developers developed these different honeypots? What are the _minimum_ requirements to create one or at least to understand more of its mode of actions?
